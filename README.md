PostBoy
===
Postboy is a simple tool to markup and prepare html mail. It utilizes
[nunjucks templates](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) (with plugins) for building markup and
[juice](https://www.npmjs.com/package/juice) for inlining CSS 

Features
---

Features not yet implemented are ***bold-italic***. Ones implemented partially are *italic*

  - Nunjucks templating engine used. 
  - Nunjucks extensions introduced for easier tables fiddeling.
  - Pre-set styles for embedding/inlined (e.g. images with display:inline-block et cetera)
  - ***ability to watch files for changes and compile them***
  - ***you can setup an SMTP server to send test e-mails***

Workflow (how postboy prepares letters for delivery)
 
  - ***you type `postboy init` and get a basic email template with some stuff already set
  - ***compiles LESS files (`embed.less` and `inline.less`) if any***
  - compiles nunjucks template (`index.html` file). ***Postboy adds its own plugin for tables. Also nunjucks-append, nunjucks-capture, nunjucks-date and nunjucks-markdown extensions used.***
  - wraps all anchor elements with `<span>` tag for Outlook styling
  - replaces html symbol entities with unicode representation (`&nbsp;` becomes `&#xA0;`)
  - inlines CSS styles from `inline.css`
  - removes CSS classes
  - embeds CSS styles from `embed.css`
  - replaces short-hand colors (`#333` becomes `#333333`)
  - ***replaces short-hand CSS properties*** 
  - ***adds image sizes***
  - *strips comments from HTML*
  - ***Beautifies HTML***
  - ***Validates XML for all your XSLT needs***
  - ***Archives the templates***
  - ***Produces different versions of templates***

That is pretty much all.

Recommendations
---

There are several rules that apply to email mark-up. Of course, if you want it to look good in most
popular mailing clients.

  - Use tables for mail. Really. CSS is kind of broken mostly in 
  - It's HTML4. Because of outlook and stuff.
  - Specify image sizes. Every single image size. For god's sake.

Initialization and file structure
---

To instsall postboy

    npm install -g postboy

To initialize the project type

    postboy init

This should create a couple folders with couple files in. All the sources will be contained within
**source** folder.

    source/
    -- css/
       -- inline.css - contains css styles that will be inlined in
                       elements (if the file exists).
       -- embed.css - styles that will be embedded in <style> tag
                      under <head> section if it exists or at the end
                      of the file if it does not.
    -- common/
       -- layout.html - Main layout (html etc)
       -- macros.html - Macros file. If it exists it will be included
                        in all the files compiled by default.

To build the mail just type `postboy`. It will look for `postboy.js` file in a folder you typed it in.
